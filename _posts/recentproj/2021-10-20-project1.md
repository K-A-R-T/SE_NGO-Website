avenue: The coronavirus outbreak has not only affected our economic conditions
  but also our mental health. Separation from loved ones, loss of freedom,
  boredom, and uncertainty can cause a deterioration in an individual's mental
  health status. In order to create a safe space for our members to share their
  problems without the fear of being judged, our club conducted a Mental Health
  Awareness session. The session was conducted by Mr Anuj Yadav, a clinical
  psychologist and a mental health campaigner.
