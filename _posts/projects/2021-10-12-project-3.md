description: "1 in 11 children go to work when they should be in school. When it
  is hard to afford necessities like food, shelter, and clothing; education
  becomes a luxury that the poor give up. Illiteracy then leads to further
  poverty. Donate for child education in India, support them with fees, school
  supplies, footwear, transport and opportunities to showcase their talents. "
